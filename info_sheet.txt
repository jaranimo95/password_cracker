Does your program run without error?: Yes

correctly?:

The password enumeration runs completely. That's it.

Additional comments to the grader:

Took too much time trying to figure out how to enumerate the passwords in any capacity,
so I was not able to complete the functionality for -check. all_passwords.txt

DLB is complete and working, 
(status of symbol table goes here)
