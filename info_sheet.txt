The password enumeration runs completely. That's it.

Additional comments to the grader:

Took too much time trying to figure out how to enumerate the passwords in any capacity 
(which, to my surprise I actually got working lol), but I was not able to start the 
functionality for -check. For some reason my PrintWriter isn't printing the values of
my char[] A array which holds the individual characters during enumeration. It seems to
me as though it is only passing in the address of the array in memory. It worked once I
assigned it as a new String, which I would then print to the file, but that took up too
much memory for how I chose to implement recursion so I just said fuck it lol this project
sucks so bad.

  - DLB is complete and working. 
  - Enumeration is working well, but the file it makes is fucking huge and not a great read.
  - Implemented the symbol table as much as I could before the deadline!
  - Don't even bother with inputting -find or -check, I didn't have time to throw them in.

I tried to make this cynical in the hopes that it would help alleviate what I would imagine
to be the crippling pain and agony of grading these projects, and I would literally sell my
soul to you for a few undeserved points here and there because wow am I going to need them!

If eternal slavery doesn't interest you, I could also buy you something idk I'm desparate at
this point haha so funny ha ha ha
